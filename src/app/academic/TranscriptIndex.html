    <h5>Official Transcript Request Information</h5> 
    <h4>An official Ryerson transcript is a complete record of a student's enrollment at Ryerson University including all undergraduate, graduate and continuing education courses, as well as credits granted towards your program.
    Since September 1, 1984, each student has had one academic record at Ryerson. This record incorporates all courses studied both through day school and continuing education.
    All officially certified transcripts will be complete and unabridged. Partial transcripts will not be issued.
    Documents pertaining to a student's achievement at another institution, which may have been received by Ryerson, will not be released.</h4>

    <h5>Fees for Transcripts</h5> 
    <h4>The cost per transcript is $15. To fax a transcript, note that you will be charged for a transcript plus the fax costs. To order transcripts via RAMSS, you must have a valid Visa, MasterCard or AMEX. When paying by credit card, you must include the name on the card, the type of credit card (Visa, MasterCard, AMEX), the credit card number and the card's expiry date. Payment must accompany all orders. Payment is non-refundable.</h4>

    <h5>Processing Time</h5> 
    <h4>Normal processing time is as soon as possible within 1 to 2 business days. During peak periods, such as the end and start of each term, normal processing time for transcripts is as soon as possible within five business days. Processing time does not include mail delivery time. All transcripts requested to be mailed are mailed via Canada Post, regular mail.
    Once your transcript has been processed, you will see your RAMSS request update to 'Completed'.
    Mailing transcripts: You are responsible for ensuring the correct mail address is submitted. Ryerson is not responsible for transcripts lost or delayed in the mail. Make sure you check your destination address before you submit your request to avoid reordering your transcript and incurring another charge. If the destination address is your home or mailing address, be sure that this information is up to date on RAMSS.
    Please "add another request" for each mailing address where you want the transcript sent.
    Picking up transcripts: Photo identification (for example, Ryerson OneCard, or government-issued identification) will be required in order to pick up a transcript at the ServiceHub POD150.</h4>

    <h5>Defer Dates</h5> 
    <h4>Defer dates allow you to postpone your transcript processing until after the date when grades are available on RAMSS after the end of term, or soon after you have graduated (so the transcript shows your graduation date/program). The defer date is important for students currently attending or recently graduated. If you require a transcript after the end of a term or directly after you have graduated, select the defer option that is appropriate.</h4>

    <h5>Instructions for completing an online request form</h5> 
    <h4>Check your unofficial transcript on RAMSS to make sure all the information you need is on your transcript including any expected grades, grade changes or appeal results.
    If you request to have your transcript produced after a specific term, please note that, even though grades may appear on RAMSS, your transcript may not be released until approximately the middle of the month following the end of the specific term.
    If you are planning to graduate and require your transcript to reflect that your degree has been conferred, please wait until the convocation ceremonies have begun before ordering your transcript.
    The online request process includes 7 required sections: Student Information, Program Information, Transcript Request Information, Summary of Requests, Official Transcript Request Agreement, Payment Details and Request and Payment Confirmation. Each section is numbered to assist you in completing the request process. The system will prompt you to complete the required information. During the request process, you have the option to save an incomplete request. Saved requests will be deleted from the system at 10pm each day. If you do not follow up to complete the saved request before 10pm you will have to start the request process over. Any partial request will not be processed.
    All required information and payment must be received before a request will be processed.</h4>
